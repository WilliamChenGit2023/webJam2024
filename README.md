## Credits
Created for [ICSSC](https://studentcouncil.ics.uci.edu/) WebJam 2024 at UCI by Will Bao, Cody Chen, William Chen, and Jianan Zhu


Programmed in Javascript and Python using [React](https://react.dev/) as the Framework


### Algorithm End

For the algorithm part, we use python opencv2 to process the images stored and detect the content in the washing machine's panel. It will show whether the washing machine is working or not. The files are in ./flaskBackend and ./otherPython.
